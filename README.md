## Build bindings

To build bindings you need to use the `generate_bindings` script. \
It needs `bindgen` installed as a CLI, you can install it with `cargo install bindgen`. \
Calling it will use the `clay.h` in the project root, or any `clay.h` file provided with `CLAY_HEADER_PATH`. \
Using the clay header it will generate `src/bindings/bindings.rs` and `src/bindings/bindings_debug.rs`.
